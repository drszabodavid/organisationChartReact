Deployed on Heroku :

This is a visualisation tool for organisation charts. \n
With this tool it is easy to see which positons are connected and what are the inputs and outputs they provide to each other. This information can be seen by clicking on one of the arrows between the positions.

Technologies : 
- React
- JointJs

My further plans are to create a backend service for the application and make the creation of a new position possible.
